# CROSSINN
## Abstract 
Data processing scripts for Doppler wind lidar data collected in the framework of the [CROSSINN](https://www.imk-tro.kit.edu/english/844_8306.php) (Cross-valley flow in the Inn Valley investigated by dual-Doppler lidar measurements) project and operated by the [ACINN](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/index.html.en) (Department of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences, [University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/index.html.en)). From 14 June 2019 to 10 October 2019, two Doppler wind lidars, model Stream Line (SL_88) and Stream Line XR (SLXR_142), manufactured by HALO Photonics and owned by the ACINN were installed at the [i-Box](https://www.uibk.ac.at/acinn/research/atmospheric-dynamics/projects/innsbruck-box-i-box.html.en) site in [Kolsass](https://acinn-data.uibk.ac.at/pages/i-box-kolsass.html) (47.305341°N, 11.62219°E). The lidars have an roating scanner head which allows for a variety of scan pattern. The Stream Line software provides profiles of radial velocity stored in txt files.
